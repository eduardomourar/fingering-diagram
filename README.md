# Flute Fingering plugin for Musescore 3.x

Flute Fingering Plugin for MuseScore 3.x is a tool to create scores with flute fingering.

### Introduction
This is a plugin that automatically adds fingering for Concert Flute or Piccolo to the score. Note that
if the staff instrument is not a flute (`wind.flutes.flute*`) then no fingering will be applied.

### Installation
* If using MuseScore version 3 then download the [plugin](https://github.com/eduardomourar/flute-fingering/archive/master.zip) and unzip it.

* Install using the [instructions](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins#installation) in the MuseScore 3.x Handbook, which typically 
involves copying the QML file to the local MuseScore Plugin directory.

* Open MuseScore and navigate to ['Plugins' -> 'Plugin Manager'](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins#enable-disable-plugins)
to enable the plugin. Tick the box against 'flutefingering' and apply with 'OK'.

* This plugin relies on a font being installed **concertflutefingering-v1.ttf**, which is included in this
download. To install the font, it is usually just a case of double-clicking the downloaded `.ttf` file 
and agreeing to the install process.
