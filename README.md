# Fingering Diagram plugin for MuseScore 3.x

Fingering Diagram Plugin for MuseScore 3.x is a tool to create scores with instrument fingering diagrams.

### Introduction
This is a plugin that automatically adds fingering diagram/chart for different musical instruments (initially for windwood) to the score. Note that if the staff instrument is not a wind instrument (`wind.*`) then no fingering will be applied. Those are the instruments with mapping created:

* Flute (wind.flutes.flute)
* Piccolo (wind.flutes.flute.piccolo)
* Soprano Recorder (wind.flutes.recorder)

### Installation
* If using MuseScore version 3 then download the [plugin](https://github.com/eduardomourar/fingering-diagram/archive/master.zip) and unzip it.

* Install using the [instructions](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins#installation) in the MuseScore 3.x Handbook, which typically involves copying the QML file to the local MuseScore Plugin directory.

* Open MuseScore and navigate to ['Plugins' -> 'Plugin Manager'](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins#enable-disable-plugins)
to enable the plugin. Tick the box against 'fingeringdiagram' and apply with 'OK'.

* This plugin relies on **Fiati** font being installed, which can be downloaded here: https://github.com/eduardomourar/fiati/releases

### Known issues

Sometimes the diagrams are placed too close together. In order to improve readability, you can either make the font smaller, or set the [minimum note distance](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure#options) to 1.5sp or higher.
